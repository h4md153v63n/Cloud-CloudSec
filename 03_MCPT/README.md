# MCSI CLOUD PENETRATION TESTER [[MCPT]](https://www.mosse-institute.com/certifications/mcpt-cloud-penetration-tester.html)
Cloud penetration testing (CPT) is the process of identifying and exploiting security vulnerabilities in a cloud infrastructure. This can include vulnerabilities in the cloud platform itself, as well as in the applications and services that run on the platform.

Professionals with cloud penetration testing skills are in high demand, as more and more businesses move to cloud-based systems. Cloud penetration testers can help identify and mitigate security risks in cloud-based systems. They are also in high demand by companies that need to comply with security regulations.

This certification program provides you with the knowledge and tools you need to test core cloud services. Upon completion, you will be able to deliver professional penetration testing engagements against AWS, GCP, and Azure.


## Course Overview
Cloud security is a critical part of any organization's security posture. As more and more businesses move to the cloud, the need for qualified penetration testers who are familiar with cloud environments has never been greater.

Cloud penetration testing is a newer form of penetration testing that focuses specifically on the security of cloud-based systems and applications. Traditional penetration testing methods can be difficult or impossible to use in a cloud environment, so cloud penetration testing uses specialized tools and techniques to test the security of cloud-based systems.

If you're looking to become a certified penetration tester capable of performing cloud penetration testing, our cloud security certification will give you the skills you need to succeed. This course covers AWS, GCP and Azure, so you'll be prepared to take on any cloud environment.

The MCSI Cloud Penetration Testing (MCPT) certification will equip you with the skillset necessary to carry out the following tasks:
   - Identify vulnerabilities in cloud services such as Cloud Formation, RDS instances, Azure AD, buckets, and lambda
   - Discover and enumerate vulnerable users and service accounts
   - Deliver post-exploitation attacks against AWS, Azure and GCP
   - Attack serverless applications and APIs

A penetration tester with cloud testing skills can earn a 6-figure salary. This is a very important skill, as cloud providers are increasingly popular targets for hackers. As more and more businesses move their operations to the cloud, the need for professionals who can protect them from cyberattacks will only grow.
